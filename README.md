Capture, Save, and Display case caption information

Sure, I can help create an add-in for Microsoft Teams that enables users to enter information in a grid and attach it to a channel. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create the add-in using the Microsoft Teams Toolkit:

Step 1: Install Microsoft Teams Toolkit
- Install the Microsoft Teams Toolkit from the Visual Studio Code Extensions marketplace.

Step 2: Create a new Project
- Open Visual Studio Code, go to the Explorer pane, and click on the Teams tab.
- Click on the "+" icon to create a new project.
- Choose "Create a new Teams tab (Microsoft Teams Toolkit)" option.
- Provide a name for your project and select a folder location to save it.

Step 3: Design the User Interface
- In the Teams Toolkit tab, click on "Design your app" button.
- Select "Static Website" for the hosting model.
- Design your UI by creating an HTML file with an input grid for entering Cause Number, County, and Date Filed information.

Step 4: Implement Functionality
- Open the generated `app.js` file in Visual Studio Code.
- Add event listeners to your HTML elements, such as the submit button, to capture the entered information.
- Validate the input fields and handle any required logic.
- Use the Microsoft Teams SDK to interact with Teams and Channels API.

Step 5: Test the Add-in Locally
- Press F5 or click on the "Run" button in Visual Studio Code to launch the local development version of the add-in.
- Install the add-in in your Teams client.
- Test the functionality and make sure the entered information is being captured correctly.

Step 6: Publish and Deploy
- Update the manifest.json file with required information like app name, description, and icons.
- Publish your add-in to the Teams App Studio or directly to the Microsoft Teams admin portal.
- Install the add-in in your Teams environment or distribute it to other users based on your deployment method.

With these steps, you will have a Microsoft Teams add-in that allows users to enter Cause Number, County, and Date Filed information in a grid format and attach it to a channel.
